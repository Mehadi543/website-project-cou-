            <p>The executive committee of the National Economic Council (ECNEC) approved a project for the establishment of twelve science and technology universities in the country during 2001 and one of these was planned to be established in Cumilla. But instead, the government granted a general university and its charter in Cumilla on 8 May 2006, as the 26th public university under which the university is being operated.

                The university formally started its journey on 28 May 2007, through an orientation program for the 2006–07 academic year with 300 students and 15 teachers enrolled in 7 departments under 4 faculties</p>

                    Three departments (Accounting & Information Systems, Management, Marketing) under the School of Business.</p>
              <br>      
              <p>
                The Department of Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) was introduced in the 2008–09 session. The Department of Bangla, Department of Anthropology and the Department of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) was introduced in the 2009–2010 session.

From the academic session 2013–14 three more department (Finance and Banking, Pharmacy and Archeology) have been introduced.
